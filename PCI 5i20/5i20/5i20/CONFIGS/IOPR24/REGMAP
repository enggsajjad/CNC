IOPR24 

72 bit parallel I/O organized as three 24 bit ports
32 bit access (8 MSbs are dont/care for port access}

BASE ADDRESS +0		24 bit I/O port = I/O bits 00..23
BASE ADDRESS +4		24 bit I/O port = I/O bits 24..47
BASE ADDRESS +8		24 bit I/O port = I/O bits 48..71
BASE ADDRESS +12	32 read/write test port


BASE ADDRESS +16	24 bit DDR register for port at 0
BASE ADDRESS +20	24 bit DDR register for port at 4
BASE ADDRESS +24	24 bit DDR register for port at 8

1 bit in DDR means cooresponding I/O bit is an output
