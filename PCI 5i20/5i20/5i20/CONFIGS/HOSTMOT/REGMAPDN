12 channel HOSTMOT With index register and 3 phase PWM option

config register map:

Index Register	0x00

Selects channel (axis) for indexed I/O

Counter		0x04	Indexed

CCR		0x08	Indexed

CCR (Counter Control Register) Bit definitions:

BIT9	CounterMode	0 = quadrature		1 = up/down
BIT8	InputFilter	0 = No filter		1 = ~2 MHz input filter
BIT7	Inbit
BIT6	LCountenable	0 = count disabled	1 = counting enabled
BIT5	ClearOnIndex	0 = no COI		1 = clear counter on index
BIT4	Latchedindex	0 = no index		1 = index detected
BIT3	IndexPolarity	0 = index active low	1 = index active high
BIT2	Index		Real time index status (reads) counter clear (writes)
BIT1	B		Real time input A status (read only)	
BIT0	A		Read time input B status (read only)

PWMVAL		0x0C	Indexed

PWMVAL is an unsigned 16 bit number which is output as 10 bit PWM 

PCR		0x10	Indexed
 					
PCR bit Definitions:

BIT2		Realtime PWM output bit status (read only)	
BIT1		Interlace enable (interlaces PWM output for use as analog out)
BIT0 		Enable -- enables PWM and ENA bit if set


TPFIFO		0x20	Indexed

TPFIFO is the port for writing the three phase PWM generators values

TPFIFO bit definitions:

BIT 15 .. 6	10 bit PWM value
BIT4		WAIT bit - causes output state machine to wait for next PWM
		Period before fetching more data from output of FIFO
BIT 1..0	PWM output channel specifier (0,1,2 for A,B,C)

Normal FIFO data would be in this sequence:
PWMA or Wait Or 00
PWMB or 01
PWMC or 02
PWMA or Wait or 00

ThreePhaseCRs:

TPCR		0x24	Indexed

TPCR bit definitions:
BIT2		ThreePhase reverse - connects ABC as BAC

BIT1		Three phase output drive enable: 
		(A,B,IDX are counter inputs if '0', 
		A,B,C outputs if '1')		

BIT0		Threephase FIFO output state machine enable
		prevents automatic unloading of FIFO if zero

FIFOCOUNT	0x28	Indexed	

Show count of PWM values queued in FIFO
Writes to FIFOCOUNT clear the FIFO

HOSTSTART	0x2C	Indexed
Writing to the HOSTSTART register allows program controlled transfer of FIFO
data to the PWM generators. When bit 0 of the TPCR is 0, the FIFO will stall
on data with the WAIT bit set until HOSTSTART is written, then the data will 
be read out of the FIFO, and stored into the selected PWM output registers 
until the next wait bit in the FIFO data stream.	



I/O port:

PORTA		0x30	24 bit I/O port (Direct)
PORTADDR	0x34	24 I/O port Data direction register - 1 = out  (Direct)


GContReg	0x40	Direct

GContReg bit definitions:

BIT3		0 = NOP		1 = Clear IRQ
BIT2		0 = NOP		1 = Clear all PWMs
BIT1		0 = NOP		1 = Latch all counters
BIT0		0 = NOP		1 = Clear all counters
 
Note GContReg is write only and "transient" you only need to write once to
accomplish the desired action, no need to clear the bit later...

GModeReg	0x44

GMode register bit definitions:

BIT6	IRQstatus	Real time IRQ status
BIT5	IRQMask		IRQ mask bit
BIT4	MissedIRQ	Missed interrupt status
BIT3	SOM		Stop on Missed interrupt control bit
BIT2	LOI		Latch on interrupt control bit
BIT1	PWMEN		Global PWM enable
BIT0	CTREN		Global counter enable

IRQDivSel	0x48

8 bit programmable divider for IRQ rate = PWM rate/(IRQDivSel+1)

RATE register	0x4C
16 bit rate register: multiplies PWM reference counter input rate by
RATE/65536 so final PWM rate = 33MHz/1024 * RATE/65536 

TPRATE register	0x4C
16 bit rate register for Three phase PWMs: multiplies PWM reference counter 
input rate by RATE/65536 so final PWM rate = 33MHz/1024 * RATE/65536 

LEDView		0x54

LED view register determines what channel the on card LEDS monitor.
LEDs monitor the following signals of the selected channel:

CR1	IRQLatch
CR2	QuadA
CR3	QuadB
CR4	IDX
CR5	DIR
CR6	PWM
CR7	ENA
CR8	OUTBIT

REFREQ counter	0x58 -- 32 bit

Reads Local bus clock for timing calibration.
Writes start a 100 mS gated frequency counter of the 33 MHz LCLK
Gate status is MSB (bit 31) of REFREQ register.
When gate becomes 0 after writing to REFREQ, frequency can be 
read from REFFREQ = LCLK/10 Hz.
