In signed mode, PWMVAL is a signed 16 bit number which is output as 
10 bit PWM plus sign on the direction bit.

In unsignedmode PWMVAL is an unsigned 16 bit number which is output as 
10 bit PWM. DIR is an input in unsigned mode.

PCR bit Definitions:
BIT4		DIR bit (input if in unsigned mode)
BIT3		Realtime PWM output bit status (read only)	
BIT2		unsigned mode bit 1 = unsigned
BIT1		Interlace enable (interlaces PWM output for use as analog out)
BIT0 		Enable -- enables PWM and ENA bit if set


GContReg	0xC0

GContReg bit definitions:

BIT3		0 = NOP		1 = Clear IRQ
BIT2		0 = NOP		1 = Clear all PWMs
BIT1		0 = NOP		1 = Latch all counters
BIT0		0 = NOP		1 = Clear all counters
 
Note GContReg is write only and "transient" you only need to write once to
accomplish the desired action, no need to clear the bit later...

GModeReg	0xC2

GMode register bit definitions:

BIT6	IRQstatus	Real time IRQ status
BIT5	IRQMask		IRQ mask bit
BIT4	MissedIRQ	Missed interrupt status
BIT3	SOM		Stop on Missed interrupt control bit
BIT2	LOI		Latch on interrupt control bit
BIT1	PWMEN		Global PWM enable
BIT0	CTREN		Global counter enable

IRQDivSel	0xC4

8 bit programmable divider for IRQ rate = PWM rate/(IRQDivSel+1)

RATE register	0xC6
16 bit rate register: multiplies PWM reference counter input rate by
RATE/65536 so final PWM rate = 33MHz/1024 * RATE/65536 


LEDView		0xC8

LED view register determines what channel the on card LEDS monitor.
LEDs monitor the following signals of the selected channel:

CR1	IRQLatch
CR2	QuadA
CR3	QuadB
CR4	IDX
CR5	DIR
CR6	PWM
CR7	ENA
CR8	OUTBIT
