NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity -
   e.g. two LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.
   When assembling slices, Map gives priority to combine logic that
   is related.  Doing so results in the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin
   packing unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are
   occupied through related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through
   related logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely
   utilized.  Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until
   all usable LUTs and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing
   budget, increased levels of unrelated logic packing may adversely
   affect the overall timing performance of your design.
